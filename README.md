# Predicting the probability of stroke

The objective of this project will be to create a model that can help doctors alleviate some of the workload, by predicting whether or not a patient is in danger of suffering a stroke. A secondary objective will be to create models that can predict bmi, average glucose level and hypertension and also several of them at the same time.
